# What Is a VLA And Why Is It 'Bad'?

A [Variable Length Array (VLA)](https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/language/array#Variable-length_arrays)
is an array where the size is not constant and depends on a variable.

VLAs have poor compiler support and can lead to inefficient code.
The core issue with VLAs is that the compiler doesn't know the size of the stack frame.
Without warning flags like `-Wvla` (turned on by `-Wall`) it can be easy to create a VLA by
accident, even in C++ with some compilers.

## Compiler Support
