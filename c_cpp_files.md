# What Are the File Types in C/C++

## Source Files: `.c|.cpp|.cxx|...`
?inline
- function definitions 
- global variable definitions
- anything used **only** in that file

Each file is compiled independently, and in parallel.
Don't `#include` them, but compile each.

## Header Files: `.h|.hpp|.tpp|...`
?inline
- forward-declarations/prototypes
- type declarations
- templates

Headers are `#include`d into other source/header files.
You will need [include guards](https://64.github.io/cpp-faq/include-guards-pragma-once/) to prevent
[redefinition errors](https://stackoverflow.com/q/3746484/5740428).

## Translation Units and Lesser Known File Extensions

Each source file becomes a *translation unit* during
[translation](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/translation_phases)
(expanding macros, remapping unicode characters, etc.) 

Sometimes `.ipp` or `.tpp` for C++ are used for internal headers with function definitions.
