# The Copy & Swap Idiom

The copy & swap idiom allows you to implement assignment operators and even the move constructor using a swap operation.
```cpp
void swap(T& a, T& b)¹ noexcept² {
    using std::swap;³ // necessary
    swap(a.x, b.x);
    swap(a.y, b.y);
    // swap every member ...
}
T& T::operator=(T other)⁴ noexcept² {
    swap(*this, other);
    return *this;
}
T::T(T&& other) : T{} noexcept² { // optional
    // default-construct, then swap
    swap(*this, other);
}
```
**\[1\]** `swap` is often implemented as a [hidden friend](https://stackoverflow.com/q/56795676/5740428)  
**\[2\]** These operations are almost always **[noexcept](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/noexcept_spec)**,
but there are rare exceptions
(e.g. if you have a **[std::list](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/list/list)** member)  
**\[3\]** Because of [argument-dependent lookup (ADL)](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/adl),
overloaded `swap` functions may be called instead of
**[std::swap](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/swap)**, which is used as a fallback.  
**\[4\]** This copy assignment is also used for move assignment.
We could implement both assignments separately, taking `const T&` and `T&&`.

## Pro & Contra
✅ simple implementation of assignments (and move constructor)  
✅ well-defined self-assignment  
✅ **[noexcept](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/noexcept_spec)** copy/move assignment
if [std::is_nothrow_swappable<T>](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/types/is_swappable)  
❌ copying always takes place, even for self-assignment  
❌ must implement custom `swap` instead of using `std::swap`
