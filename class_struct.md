# What is the Difference Between class and struct?

The keywords
**[class](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/keyword/class)** and
**[struct](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/keyword/struct)** both declare a so-called
*[class type](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/class)*.
The declared class will have different properties, such as default
[member access](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/access), depending on whether `class` or `struct` was used.

## class
?inline
- members `private` by default
- `private` [inheritance](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/derived_class) from base class by default
- incompatible with C
- typically used for larger classes

## struct
?inline
- members `public` by default
- `public` [inheritance](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/derived_class) from base class by default
- compatible with C
- typically used for [aggregates](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/aggregate_initialization),
[traits](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/header/type_traits)
