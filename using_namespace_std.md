# Why Is `using namespace std` Considered Bad Practice?

`using namespace std` will import **all** of the symbols from `std` into the current scope.
This can easily lead to name collisions, as the standard library is filled with common names:
`get`, `count`, `map`, `array`, etc.

A **key concern** with
`using namespace std;` is not what is imported now but rather what may suddenly be imported in the
future.

While `using namespace std;` is alright for tiny projects, it is important to move away from it as
soon as possible. Consider less intrusive options, if you insist on not using scope resolution:
```cpp
// OK: *only* import std::vector
using std::vector;
// OK: namespace alias
namespace chr = std::chrono;
chr::duration x;
```
