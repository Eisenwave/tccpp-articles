# Iterators And Pointers

Iterators in C++ are lightweight, non-owning types which provide a view into a range of elements.
They must satisfy [named requirements](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req), or
[concepts](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/constraints#Concepts) (since C++20).
For instance, an *[Iterator](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/Iterator)*
must have a `++i`, and `*i` operator.

Not all iterators are pointers, but they are modeled after pointers.
`++i`, `*i`, `i == j`, etc. for iterators should have the same semantics as operations between pointers.

## Named Requirements
?inline
- *[InputIterator](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/InputIterator)*
- *[ForwardIterator](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/ForwardIterator)*
- *[BidirectionalIterator](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/BidirectionalIterator)*
- *[RandomAccessIterator](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/RandomAccessIterator)*
- *[ContiguousIterator](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/ContiguousIterator)*
- *[OutputIterator](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/OutputIterator)*

## Concepts (since C++20)
?inline
- **[std::input_iterator](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/iterator/input_iterator)**
- **[std::forward_iterator](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/iterator/forward_iterator)**
- **[std::bidirectional_iterator](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/iterator/bidirectional_iterator)**
- **[std::random_access_iterator](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/iterator/random_access_iterator)**
- **[std::contiguous_iterator](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/iterator/contiguous_iterator)**
- **[std::output_iterator](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/iterator/output_iterator)**

## Pointers Are Contiguous Iterators

Because pointers satisfy the most capable named requirement
*[ContiguousIterator](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/ContiguousIterator)*,
they can always be used as iterators, e.g.:
- your `begin()` and `end()` functions can return pointers;
**[std::array](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/array)**
is often implemented like this
- you can use pointers in algorithms like **[std::sort](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/sort)**
