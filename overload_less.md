# Overloading the Less Than Operator

The less than operator returns `true` iff one object less than the other.
If it establishes a [strict weak ordering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_ordering#Strict_weak_orderings),
it makes a type
*[LessThanComparable](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/LessThanComparable)*,
which allows using the type in a `std::map`, in `std::sort` and other algorithms.

## Example
```cpp
struct point {
    int x, y;
    // explicit defaulting since C++20
    bool operator>(const point&) const = default;
};
// can also be defined outside the class
bool operator<(point a, point b) {
    return a.x < b.x ||
           a.x == b.x && a.y < b.y;
}
```
